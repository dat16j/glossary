#Glossary
A class is a template for creating different objects 
which defines its properties and behaviors. 
It can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires 
the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of 
inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

A Domain Model is a way to describe and model real world entities 
and the relationships between them.

SWOT Analysis, which stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, 
is an analytical framework that can help your company face its greatest 
challenges and find its most promising new markets.

a package
Java packages are a mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the same "module" (package). A Java package is like a directory in a file system. In fact, on the disk a package is a directory. All Java source and class files of classes belonging to the same package are located in the same directory.

a scope

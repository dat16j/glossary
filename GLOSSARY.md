#Glossary
##Group 1
A class is a template for creating different objects 
which defines its properties and behaviors. 
It can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires 
the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of 
inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

A Domain Model is a way to describe and model real world entities 
and the relationships between them.

SWOT Analysis, which stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, 
is an analytical framework that can help your company face its greatest 
challenges and find its most promising new markets.

##Group 2
Artefacts - Artefacts are produced by people involved in a project. These artefacts are everything that is used to convey information to the other people involved in the project such as diagrams, models ect.

Use case - Use cases are descriptions of objectives that can be done with the program and describes the process of obtaining this objective.

attribute - specification that defines a property of an object, element or file.

inheritance - a feature of OOP languages by which classes may be specialized from more general superclasses. Attributes and method definitions from superclasses are automatically aquired by the subclass.

Encapsulation – the policy of hiding unnecessary details and protecting information that is not supposed to be easily changed by the users.

Statement – the smallest executable piece of code that tells the computer to perform a specific task. It is analogues to a sentence in human language.

## Group 3
an array
a collection of variables of the same type. For instance, an array of int is a collection of variables of the type int. The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index.

an artifact 
one of many kinds of tangible by-products produced during the development of software. Some artifacts (e.g., use cases, class diagrams, and other Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, requirements and design documents) help describe the function, architecture, and design of software.

an attribute
a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file.

a package
Java packages are a mechanism to group Java classes that are related to each other, into the same "module" (package). A Java package is like a directory in a file system. In fact, on the disk a package is a directory. All Java source and class files of classes belonging to the same package are located in the same directory.

a scope
Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs and deadlines.

a stakeholder 
A stakeholder in the architecture of a system is an individual, team, organization, or classes thereof, having an interest in the realization of the system. It is important to ensure that there is adequate stakeholder representation across the board, including non-technology stakeholders (such as acquirers and users) and technology-focused ones (such as developers, system administrators, and maintainers).

an artefact - everything that is man made

optimisation - In mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimisation (alternatively, mathematical programming) is the selection of a best element from some set of available alternatives.

## Group 4
Iteration
repetition of a computational procedure applied to the result of a previous application, 
typically as a means of obtaining successively closer approximations to the solution of a problem.

Method
a function from a class. 

Artifact
In software development life cycle (SDLC), artifact usually refers to "things" that are 
produced by people involved in the process.

String 
Initialises a newly created object so that it represents the same sequence of characters as the argument; 
in other words, the newly created string is a copy of the argument string.

Object oriented programming 
is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, 
in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, 
often known as methods.

Dynamic memory allocation
C dynamic memory allocation refers to performing manual memory management for dynamic 
memory allocation in the C programming language via a group of functions in the C 
standard library, namely malloc, realloc, calloc and free

End-user development (EUD) or end-user programming (EUP)
activities and tools that allow end-users ñ people who are not professional 
software developers ñ to program computers.

Inductive programming (IP) 
a special area of automatic programming, covering research from artificial 
intelligence and programming, which addresses learning of typically declarative 
(logic or functional) and often recursive programs from incomplete specifications, 
such as input/output examples or constraints.

## Group 5
Domain model - A domain model is a description of things in the real world which is used as a starting point in programming.

Method - A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name.

Membership card - A physical plastic card used by a person to acces the facilities of the companies and store information and balance.

User - consumer using the facilities and offers from a company.

Balance: - is the consumers amount of money he has on his account.

Database - a system that contains all the information from different consumers and their statistics.

Use Case Diagram:   Digaram that shows how objects/actors interact within a system or one another through multiple different 

For loop: An argument that allows to repeat an argument as many times as desired.

(OOAD) Object-oriented analysis and design - It is a technical approach for analyzing, designing an application, system, or business.

(UML) Unified Modeling Language - It is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system
